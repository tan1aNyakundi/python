# Create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. 
# We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:
#- Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
#- Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
#- Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

#Coding Question 
#- Create a function named large_power()that takes two parameter named base and exponent.


def large_power(base, exponent):
    # Calculate base raised to the power of exponent
    result = base ** exponent
    
    # Check if result is greater than 5000
    if result > 5000:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Example test cases
print(large_power(10, 4))  # 10^4 = 10000 → True
#print(large_power(2, 10))  # 2^10 = 1024 → False
#print(large_power(8, 5))   # 8^5 = 32768 → True
