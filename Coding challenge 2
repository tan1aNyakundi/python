# 1. Divisible by ten
#	Create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. 
#  Using this, we can complete this function in a few steps:
#1. Define the function header to accept one input num
#2. Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
#3. Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False
	 
#	Coding question
# Create a function called divisible_by_ten() that has one parameter named num.
# The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise. Consider using modulo operator % to check for divisibility.


def divisible_by_ten(num):
   result = num % 10
   print(result)
   
   if result == 0:
      return True
   else:
      return False
num = int(input("Enter number: "))
divisible_by_ten(num)
